# MultiDayEvent with events on several, non-contiguous days
#
# This class doesn't add any special behavior to MultiDayEvent, but it is 
# convential to separate events like stage races from series like the 
# Cross Crusade
#
# By convention, only SingleDayEvents have Standings and Results -- WeeklySeries do not. 
# Final standings like Overall GC are associated with the last day's SingleDayEvent.
