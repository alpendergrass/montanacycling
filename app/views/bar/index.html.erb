<p>Oregon Best All-Around Rider (BAR) a year-round, multi-discipline competition open to annual members. Points and ranking will be tracked in at least the following categories: Senior Men and Women, Cateogry 3 Men, Category 4/5 Men, Category 3 Women, Category 4 Women, Masters Men and Women, Junior Men and Women, Singlespeed/Fixed, Tandem.</p>

<p>There are eight separate discipline rankings, one each for Road, Track, Criterium, Time Trial, Cyclocross, Cross-country Mountain Biking, and and Downhill/SuperD. Points are awarded for finishes at all OBRA races for the top 15 in each discipline: 30, 25, 22, 19, 17, 15, 13, 11, 9, 7, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.</p>

	<p>State Championships are awarded double points. National caliber races are awarded triple points. </p>

	<p>Points earned in team events are split evenly across the team members. Example: the winners of a three-person team time trial will each receive 10 points.</p>

	<p>Tandem teams earn points as a team. Tandem points do not count toward individual rider points.</p>

	<p>If a rider has multiple finishes in a single event, only the best finish counts. </p>

	<p>If a rider has multiple discipline rankings that would count towards the same overall category, only the best ranking counts.</p>

	<p>Weeknight events will accrue points for each month of racing.</p>

<p>Points are tallied and riders are ranked in order of points in each discipline. The rider with the highest point tally in each discipline is awarded 300 "ranking" points, the rider with the second highest is awarded 299, third gets 298, etc. If a rider has points in more than 4 disciplines, he/she is awarded 50 additional ranking points for each discipline over 4. This means that there is a total 1200 points possible with a possible additional bonus of 150. </p>

<p>These ranking numbers are then added to determine annual awards.  Riders must compete in a minimum of 4 disciplines in order to qualify annual trophies.     </p>

<p>The Team BAR awarded based on the sum of the accrued points before rankings. </p>
