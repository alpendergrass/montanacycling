I wanted to thank everyone that has sent in donations so far.  We have a total of $1,900! In addition, Chris King is donating a headset and a pair of his sweet hubs, and Michael Sylvester will be providing fitting services for Candi. 

However, we still need $600 to reach the goal of giving Candi a Vanilla to show our appreciation. I would very much appreciate if you could spread the word out more and donate if you haven't already done so.  The donation directions are provided below and I have attached a copy of my original email. 

The current $1,900 in donations comes from less than 65 people and I believe that considerably more OBRA members are interested in showing their appreciation to Candi for all that she has done for Oregon cycling over the past 20 years.  We only need 15% of the 3,000+ OBRA members to donate $6 (the mere cost of a good tube) to reach the goal of covering the cost of the frameset.  The current donations average about $30 per person.  The bike stores listed below are donating the cost of the Dura-ace build kit. 

I would like to have all the funds collected by the end of January, so that we present Candi with her gift at the February banquet. At the banquet we will be presenting Candi with an invite to visit Sasha and Michael Sylvester to start the building of the custom Candi Vanilla machine.
