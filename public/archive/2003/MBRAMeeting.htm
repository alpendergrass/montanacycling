concern for racers. Bechtold suggested that a person known and respected by
racers and who is familiar with the racers would be a better fit than Whitacre
as Upgrades Coordinator. Don Russell noted that shouldering both tasks was an
onerous burden and offered to act as Upgrades Coordinator. Weyhrich amended his
motion to designate Rob Whitacre as Official’s Coordinator and Don Russell as

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The board discussed the cyclocross schedule for the
fall.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Landstrom noted that Flathead
would like to host the State Championship race on November 8 or 9, and so
moved. Weyhrich seconded, and all approved. Mohr suggested that cross races be
on Saturdays if possible, rather than Sundays, noting that fewer schedule
conflicts arise on Saturdays for many racers. Weyhrich suggested that Montana
Velo and Great Divide host their cross races back-to-back on a Saturday and
Sunday, since few racers are willing to travel across the state for a one-hour
race, having two races in the same town on the same weekend might entice more
racers. Weyhrich also suggested that Northern Rockies and Five Valley Velo
could do the same on one weekend in Missoula as well, so racers could get more
racing with less travel time. Bechtold stated that he and Mike Beltz were
organizing a weekday cross series for Northern Rockies and Five Valley Velo in
Missoula that would run six weeks from mid-September until late October,
probably at Fort Missoula. Weyhrich suggested that the series be on Wednesday
nights so racers could be ready for weekend racing. Bechtold stated that he
would post a tentative schedule for the 2003 cross races on the listserv and
the final schedule could be worked out in the next week or so via email. All
agreed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Landstrom stated that Flathead wanted to move its
race to sometime in May or June. Bechtold suggested that MBRA consider moving
all road races so the season ends in mid-July, perhaps at the time of the
Cascade Classic. Herzig noted that MBRA needs to try a different schedule,
since there is such a dramatic drop in racer numbers for July and August races.
Deford suggested that MBRA set a time for the state championship race and have
that be the end of the season, perhaps at the end of June or early in July, so
that Montana racers have two big events to train for, first the Ecology Center
race and then the state championship race at least four or five weeks later.
Given that the Ecology race is on Memorial Day weekend, the end of June would
be far enough removed to allow another training goal. Mohr offered that the end
of June is the traditional time for championship races, and it would work well
to have Montana’s championship race then. Weyhrich pointed out that MBRA needs
to work its schedule around some of the large regional races so that Montana
racers can travel to these races, mostly in Washington and Oregon. Bechtold
informed the board that Five Valley Velo was interested in truncating its
spring training series to one race and having the remaining weekends in March
available for Cup Series races, either for Five Valley Velo races or other races.
Deford commented that the training series races are important for attracting
new people to racing and we should not change them all to “real” races. There
was general agreement that the first flat race at Clinton should be a training
race, but the later races could be Cup Series races. Weyhrich noted that he was
interested in developing new venues if open dates were available for Cup Series
races. All agreed not to make a firm decision on the 2004 schedule, but to
discuss it further within the member clubs. Bechtold offered to draft a
proposed schedule and post it for comment and review.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>All present expressed an interest in enhancing the
Montana Cup Series. Herzig suggested that the series jersey be a leader’s
jersey that the current leader wears, rather than the past year’s winner. All
agreed that this was good idea, and Weyhrich moved for approval to purchase
three jerseys for 2004, estimating that the jerseys will be about $70-80 each.
Deford seconded. All approved. The jerseys would only be for Men Cat 1,2 and W
Cat 1,2,3, though other cats will have series competition. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.75in'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The board approved the following for the Montana Cup
Series:</p>

tab-stops:list 1.0in'><![if !supportLists]>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

1,2,3; Women 4. </p>

</span><![endif]>MBRA will issue two copies of the same number to each racer at
the start of the season or upon that racer’s first series race. The racer will
pay $1 for the numbers. The racer will retain the number for the remainder of
season. If the racer loses or mangles one copy of the number, the racer can use
the second one. If the racer loses both, then the racer will have to pay $5 to
have a replacement number issued. </p>

tab-stops:list 1.0in'><![if !supportLists]>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><![endif]>Numbers will be issued in unique groupings for each class. For
example, all Men 1,2 racers will have numbers between 1 and 99. All Women 1,2,3
racers will have numbers between 101 and 199, etc.</p>

its race and award prizes according to its own groupings, but Cup Series points
will be derived according to the Cup Series classes. For example, a race may
have a Men 1,2,3 class, a Men 4,5 class, a Masters 35+ class, and a Women’s
class. For Cup Series rankings, the Cat 3 men would be awarded points according
to their finish relative to other Cat 3 men in the race. Similarly, masters who
are really 55+ would be awarded points according to their finish relative to
other 55+ racers, etc.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Weyhrich reported that MBRA has received $995 to
date from USCF in license payments. MBRA receives $5 from every license fee
that a Montanan pays to USCF. Board members agreed that as a general policy the
President of MBRA could spend up to $100 for managerial or clerical expenses at
his discretion after informing the rest of the board via email, but that
expenses of more than $100 need the approval of a majority of the board. Under
the bylaws, email approval is OK, so the President can approve of an expense as
soon as a majority of the designated directors email that the expense is OK.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.75in'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Bechtold suggested that the board consider a $1 per
racer per race surcharge to go to MBRA to support things like the Cup Series
prizes and other expenses that may arise. Deford stated that a $1 per racer is
often the difference between breaking even in a race, and this could be a
burden for promoters. Herzig suggested that promoters should just increase
their entry fee by a dollar. Deford related the hassle of making change if an
entry fee were raised to $21 from $20. Mohr and Herzig both noted that racers
would not balk at the dollar increase if they knew the money was going to fund
the overall series prize money. Landstrom suggested that such a surcharge be
devoted to fund the Montana Series Cup and potentially other things like junior
development. Mohr moved that MBRA impose a $1/racer/race surcharge. Landstrom
seconded. All approved without further discussion.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Bechtold suggested that each club be obligated to
supply an official to a different club’s race so that we can avoid the
appearance of impropriety and comply with the rules requiring non-host club
judges. Russell expressed concern that inexperienced officials should not be
tossed into a race situation without some guidance and support. Mohr commented
that there needed to be flexibility for officials to makes changes as their
time commitments developed. Weyhrich commented that both these concerns should
be easy to avoid with some advance scheduling and flexibility that allows clubs
and officials to make changes as situations arise. Herzig noted that smaller
clubs might have difficulty providing an official. Russell stated that he would
be conducting an official’s clinic in February so people would have the chance
to upgrade or become officials then. Herzig then moved, Weyhrich seconded, that
each club provide an official for at least one other club’s race per year. The
board approved this with no further discussion.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Bechtold suggested that the board consider devoting
funds to junior development and racer recruitment. Herzig noted that Geoff
Proctor had volunteered to coordinate or be involved in junior development, but
that it would cost some money for expenses. Each board member offered some idea
of what junior development might entail and what it might cost, and in the end
decided that the most prudent path would be to seek proposals from people
interested in working on junior development that includes both an outline of a
proposed program and proposed costs. Deford moved that MBRA put out a request
for such proposals and the board could review them and decide what to do at a
later date. Landstrom seconded. All were in favor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.75in'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Deford moved, Herzig seconded, that junior entry
fees in all MBRA Cup Series races be a maximum of $5. Deford actually wanted
the entry fees for juniors to be zero dollars, but because of USCF and MBRA
fees, $5 seemed like a reasonable maximum. All approved. So the entry fee for
juniors is now set at a maximum of $5 for all MBRA Cup Series races. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Deford wondered if there were a way to make sure
that more than one bicycle event is not scheduled for the same day in Montana,
including rides such as TSRV and RATPOD, mountain bike races, and road races.
Deford noted specifically the conflict between the Bozeman and Dillon mountain
bike races, which were held on the same day. Mohr wondered what sort of
influence MBRA could have on NORBA events and NORBA scheduling. Weyhrich noted,
and all agreed that we should work cooperatively to try to avoid schedule
conflicts, but that the free market prevails and MBRA cannot stop someone from
holding an event. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That concluded the items of discussion, and Herzig moved,
Weyhrich seconded, to adjourn the meeting. All in favor. Meeting adjourned at
4:45 pm.</p>
