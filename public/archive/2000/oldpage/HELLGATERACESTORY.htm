<P>Missoula Hellgate Duathlon</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Cool temperatures, a wet course and a smattering of rain were not enough to</P>
<P>stop Georgia Gould from winning the individual women’s category and besting</P>
<P>the women’s course record by two minutes at Saturday’s seventh annual Five</P>
<P>Valley Velo / Team Stampede Hellgate Duathlon.</P>

<P>&quot;It didn’t feel fast doing it,&quot; Gould said.  &quot;It felt bad.&quot;</P>

<P>The race course, at Kreis Pond in the Ninemile Ranger District West of</P>
<P>Missoula, started with a 4k run.  The first half took runners on a fast</P>
<P>sprint down through the woods only to then make them struggle right back up.</P>

<P>After a 15k mountain bike leg, the competitors had a second go on the same</P>
<P>run course for another 4k.</P>

<P>&quot;That second climb was never ending,&quot; Gould said.  A newcomer to Missoula</P>
<P>from Ketchum, Idaho, she has just started racing and this was her first</P>
<P>duathlon.</P>

<P>For UM student Emily Sandall, who took second in the women’s category, this</P>
<P>duathlon was also a first.</P>

<P>&quot;It was an exciting race,&quot; Sandall said.  &quot;The organization was really</P>
<P> good.&quot;</P>

<P>In the men’s category, Hellgate High Staffer Mike Birnbaum led pretty much</P>
<P>from beginning to end.</P>

<P>&quot;I felt really strong,&quot;  Birnbaum said.  &quot;It was pretty exciting on the</P>
<P>bike.&quot;</P>

<P>Jacob Hartsoch (TS5VV-Msla), who placed second overall, stayed with Birnbaum</P>
<P>during the bike leg.</P>

<P>&quot;I felt pretty good on the bike,&quot;  Hartsoch said.  &quot;But still it was all I</P>
<P>could do to stay with him.  I was thinking ‘Who is this guy?’&quot;</P>

<P>Coming into the second transition, Hartsoch was only ten seconds behind</P>
<P>Birnbaum.  &quot;You can kinda fake it on the first run,&quot;  Hartsoch said of his</P>
<P>own performance.   But on the second run he saw his chance for a victory</P>
<P>evaporate when he lost close to a minute on the lead, allowing Mike Birnbaum</P>
<P>to run away with a win.</P>
