<P>Montana Cyclocross race number five, held in Missoula, had riders trying to</P>
<P>survive the course while putting seconds between each other. The start was</P>
<P>a two hundred yard sprint on gravel. Then riders entered the woods for nine</P>
<P>laps mostly on single track.</P>
<P>Jake Hartsoch was first to the woods followed closely by Geoff Proctor,</P>
<P>Brink Kuchenbrod, and Scott Herzig. But Hartsoch hadn’t planned on leading</P>
<P>the first lap.</P>
<P>"I always screw up the start and go out too fast," Hartsoch said. But on</P>
<P>this tight technical course, maybe it wasn’t a mistake to get out ahead.</P>
<P>The course had a few run up sections and the standard barriers to jump over,</P>
<P>but the real obstacle proved to be an overly steep downhill. It spiraled</P>
<P>out of the woods and threw riders down a rutted rocky trail only to dump</P>
<P>them into a flat hairpin turn at the bottom. All the top riders in both the</P>
<P>men’s and women’s categories either crashed on the downhill or missed the</P>
<P>turn at the bottom and wound up in the bushes sometime during the race.</P>
<P>After the downhill and a few more gyrations in the woods, a long flat</P>
<P>single-track section sped things up and also provided the most spectacular</P>
<P>crash of the day.</P>
<P>On the backside of the second lap, the top six riders were still within ten</P>
<P>seconds with Proctor in the lead.</P>
<P>"I didn’t feel good enough to ride away in the beginning," Proctor said.</P>
<P>Kuchenbrod took advantage of the passing room in the grass and got ahead of</P>
<P>Proctor.</P>
<P>"I was just getting into it…when I hit a hole," Proctor said.</P>
<P>"He was going to pass me right back," Kuchenbrod said, but the pass never</P>
<P>came. "I heard the ‘huh’ as he went down hard and the air came out."</P>
<P>One observer said, "It looked like his bike just washed out from underneath</P>
<P>him."</P>
<P>In the crash Proctor injured his thigh and, although he took one more lap,</P>
<P>was unable to finish the race.</P>
<P>"I could barely drive to the gas station to get ice," he said.</P>
<P>With Proctor out, Kuchenbrod led for the rest of the race only a few seconds</P>
<P>ahead of Scott Herzig until the last two laps when Herzig almost caught him.</P>
<P>"I was making mistakes left and right," Kuchenbrod said. "I thought, ‘If I</P>
<P>don’t get it together, [Herzig’s] gonna pass me.’"</P>
<P>Kuchenbrod held on for the win and after a slew of second places he was</P>
<P>happy. "I think that’s my first win in five years," he said.</P>
<P>For the women, Margie Legg lead from beginning to end.</P>
<P>"It was fun," Legg said. "I got to ride my husband’s titanium bike, but I</P>
<P>don’t think it helped much."</P>
<P>Jennifer Carey finished in second place.</P>
<P>"I had her in sight on the second lap," Carey said, "but then I crashed on</P>
<P>the downhill and never saw her again." But none of it dampened her mood.</P>
<P>"It was great cheap entertainment," Carey said after the race.</P>
