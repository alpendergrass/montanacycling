<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>Due to the small number of racers present at this race, I decided to take a page out of the training race handbook and start everyone at once.  My intentions for the race were fairly simple; a fast, flat course with 5 ten mile loops--and one short but steep hill each lap.  </P>
<P>As soon as the race rolled out of the neutral zone, Geoff Proctor set things alight with an attack that kept the lead car at over 45 mph for a few miles.  Despite his efforts, Proctor was reeled in by Todd "Pro/Cat3" Struckman, who was intent on honoring his new Bitterroot turf with Jacky Durand type antics.  </P>
<P>After a regrouping, things stayed calm until the last 2.5 miles of lap two when Matt Seeley went on the offensive to claim the Kettlehouse King of the Hill Prime.  Although Seeley barely edged out the pack for the growler, his pace had left the field in tatters, with the 1-3 men out front to keep him in check and 4-5 &amp; masters men scattered over a short distance. John Fiore was the only non 1-3 to make the selection, which would bode well for Montana Velo in their efforts agains FVVs orange machine, as Brink Kuchenbroad exited the race with a mechanical earlier in the lap.</P>
<P>This would prove to be the definative point in the race, as the 7 man break powered away from the rapidly regrouping field.  For the next 3 laps, the break never let anyone more than 10 seconds clear.  As the pack rolled into the finish, Five Valley Velo's John Wehyrich launched an attack at the bottom of the hill narrowly edging a fast charging Geoff Proctor and Bozeman's Chad Devall.  Despite being dropped by the lead break, John Fiore managed to hang on and take home the masters 35-44</P>
<P>Several minutes later, the regrouped 4/5 and master's field arrived at the base of the hill with GVBC's John Behrens on the attack.  As he charged toward the line, ECaps Will Schnieder zipped around Behrens to take the win with Cory Custer rolling in third.</P>
<P>In the women's race, Sus Gaunt hung with the main group until the main break on lap 2 as Seeley was chased down.  Regardless, she took the Kettlehouse Queen of the Hill.  Behind her, Eryn Hanna chased relentlessly for 30 miles despite running out of water early in the second lap.    </P>
<P>Special thanks go to Tim O'Leary at Kettlehouse and Charlie Barbie and Dale at the Big Dipper, as well as Len &amp; Dan at Open Road.  All of these guys support bike racing without question so return the favor and support them by frequenting their establishments.</P>
<P>This race would not have been possible without the help of Jeff Crouch, Randy Ristau, Mark Legg and the Hanna entourage who volunteered in a pinch!  If you know these people, please thank them, they did a great job on short notice with little thanks.</P>
