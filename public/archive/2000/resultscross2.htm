</B></U><P>&gt;From the beginning Mark Legg of 5 Valley Velo-Missoula ran away from the</P>
<P>field in the Montana Supercup Prestige Cyclocross #2 in Helena. The course</P>
<P>was tight with plenty of single track and after the first of three steep</P>
<P>run-up sections, Legg had opened a small gap over the field that he would</P>
<P>only improve upon the rest of the race.</P>
<P>"I wasn’t too sure how I was going to do," Legg said, citing a "touch" of</P>
<P>over training. But on the course none of that was apparent.</P>
<P>"I was feeling pretty good." Legg said after he finished a minute and a</P>
<P>half in front of second place.</P>
<P>With number one decided, the rest of the field was left racing for second</P>
<P>spot. Half way through the second lap the chase group of</P>
<P>of Brink Kuchenbrod (MT Velo-Msla), Scott Herzig (MT Velo-Hlna), Dan Swanson</P>
<P>(MSU-Bzmn), Jacob Hartsoch (5VV=Msla),and Jon Burkhartsmeyer (MT Velo-Hlna)</P>
<P>was still tightly packed.</P>
<P>The course wound through the trees with fast single track sections and four</P>
<P>places to dismount (five for the riders who didn’t tackle the uphill log</P>
<P>bunny-hop).</P>
<P>By the third lap Kuchenbrod and Herzig had opened a twenty second gap.</P>
<P>Hartsoch had come up to fourth place where he would wind up finishing.</P>
<P>"It was tough out there," said Hartsoch. "I started out too hard and paid</P>
<P>the price."</P>
<P>The contest for second lasted the entire ten laps with Kuchenbrod opening a</P>
<P>six second gap on lap six.</P>
<P>"I couldn’t stay with him," Herzig said.</P>
<P>Despite a late effort by Herzig, Kuchenbrod was able to hold on to finish</P>
<P>second.</P>
<P>"I felt better than expected," Kechenbrod said. "It’s nice to have a</P>
<P>confidence edge."</P>
<P>For the women, Margie Legg of 5 Valley Velo-Missoula had a great time.</P>
<P>"[This] was really fun," Legg said, "I’ll probably do the whole series."</P>
<P>She said Eryn Hanna (Great Divide-Hlna) would have been a tough competitor</P>
<P>if she had not had a mechanical and missed two laps.</P>
<P>This was the last race before Mark Legg goes to Sydney, Australia as the</P>
<P>mechanic for the U.S. Para-Olympic Bicycle team. Coverage of Legg’s trip</P>
<P>will be included in a future issue of Outdoorpulp.</P>
