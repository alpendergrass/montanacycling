<P>Petter Jorgensen, visiting from Norway, swept Montana Prestige Cup</P>
<P>cyclocross races #3 and #4 this past weekend in Bozeman.</P>

<P>For Saturday, the annual course at Lindley Park was redesigned.  A steep,</P>
<P>off camber turn at the corner of the park had to be taken slowly to avoid</P>
<P>sliding onto Main street and riders had to stay alert not to miss turns</P>
<P>obscurely flagged in the open grass.</P>

<P>Fifty minutes before the 3:00 start time, the rain turned to snow flurries</P>
<P>and riders were still trying to decide whether or not to race.</P>

<P>&quot;It’s gonna be a slop-fest,&quot; one rider said as he filled out his</P>
<P>registration.</P>

<P>Jorgensen (Follo-Norway)was not bothered by the snow or mud and jumped out</P>
<P>to an early lead of ten seconds over Brink Kuckenbrod (Montana Velo-Msla).</P>

<P>Jorgensen, riding a mountain bike, was able to bunny-hop (or otherwise bash</P>
<P>his way) over half the obstacles on the course.</P>

<P>This was a big disadvantage for Kuckenbrod.</P>

<P>&quot;I lost contact on the first lap because I had to dismount,&quot; he said, but</P>
<P>also gave credit to Jorgensen.  &quot;I got a thrashing by a guy with a set of</P>
<P>legs.  I felt super but I had to wonder if that guy was in the next county.&quot;</P>
<P>Asked if he was going to race on Sunday, he cited a hunting commitment.</P>

<P>On Sunday the course was changed for more running, but that did little to</P>
<P>change the outcome.  Jorgensen still grabbed an early lead, this time over</P>
<P>Dan Swanson (MSU-Bzmn), and finished with a two minute gap.</P>

<P>&quot;I’ve never competed in cyclocross before,&quot; the twenty year old Norwegian</P>
<P>said, &quot;it was dirty, but nice.&quot;  Jorgensen hopes to turn pro sometime soon.</P>

<P>The next race in the series is in Missoula on October 28th.  Contact Brink</P>
<P>Kuckenbrod at kuch@bigsky.net for details.</P>
