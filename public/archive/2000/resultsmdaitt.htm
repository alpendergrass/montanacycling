<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>The Marcus Daly Time Trial was held on Saturday July 22. The Marcus Daly cirucit race was held earlier in the day</P>
<P>so several of the riders were feeling the pain of having ridden in the 90 degree heat.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The course was 8 miles of silky smooth asphalt on Sleeping Child Road outside of Hamilton. The course consisted of </P>
<P>4 miles of climbing at around a 3 percent grade, then 4 miles back downhill.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Geoff Proctor (Montana Velo) won the event by a slim 7 seconds over John Weyrich (Five Valley Velo) who had won earlier</P>
<P>in the day. The women's even was won by Becky Broeder (Five Valley Velo). She edged out Eryn Hanna (Great Divide) by only</P>
<P>8 seconds.</P>
