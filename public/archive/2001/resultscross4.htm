<P>The fourth stop in the Montana Cyclocross series was held at the Fort Missoula complex. This race area has been used for only two years now but it is quickly becoming legend among racers. Sunday's race brought 33 racers out of their nice warm cars into the rain and mud.</P>

<P>As my view of the race was from the very back I can't give you much of a race narrative. It seems that the race stayed together for  much longer  than usual. At the beginning of the first lap all of the racers hit the tree slalom section of the course at the same time making for some great leaning shoving and jockeying for position. After that, the real racing started and Geoff Proctor (Montana Velo) and Jamul Hahn (Northern Rockies) pulled steadily away from the field. Behind them (by at least a minute) Montana Velo's Scott Herzog and Brian Wirak rode lap after lap with one another.</P>

<P>What should have been a classic last lap duel between former Nutra Fig Pro Hahn and Former Worlds Cross Racer Proctor turned into an easy win for Hahn as Proctor suffered a flat on the last lap. (someone needs to get this guy some Mr. Tuffy's) The folks at the line reported that Hahn turned onto the last straight away ready for a sprint only to discover that his foe had disappeared. Junior rider Wirak outpaced teammate Herzog to take third.</P>

<P>The women's race was won by Sandol Brinig over her Five Valley Velo teammate Margie Legg. GVBC's Jon Engen won the masters race and Jim Noonan won the men's B race.</P>

<P>Thanks to all of those who raced. A HUGE thanks to all of those who volunteered. Richard Allen, Mark Burke (and family), Ed Vanaelstyn, Karen Lake, Steve Dolberg, Jeff Cincoski (and friend), Monique Lary, Charlie Beaton, Head Scorer Len Lebuff, Mark Legg, photographers Susanna Gaunt and Becky Broeder, and the guy with the stop sign (sorry I don't know your name). (and any others I am forgetting) You all deserve a medal of honor for standing in the rain!</P>

<P>Also, many thanks to race director John Weyhrich who missed a chance to race and stayed out by himself cleaning the course up until 4:30 pm (with no jacket or gloves). After a long season this race was especially taxing on race directors and friends.  Next time you are at a race you might offer to help pick up a few cones after the race.</P>

<P>Attached you will find results and photos. The series standings will be published as soon as results from cross race number one are received. (hint, hint)</P>
