<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>TENTATIVE WASHINGTON 2001 RACING SCHEDULE</P>

<P>&gt;From the Meeting this Saturday we have this Tentative Race Calendar for the State of Washington. It also includes some of the major events in neighboring states. If you have any corrections or additions please let me know ASAP. If you have a web site that include more information about your race, please send it along and i will create a link from the calendar to your site. Note this calendar is a work in progress and will most likely have some changes. The most recent edition will be posted at www.pazzovelo.com by Jan. 1.</P>

<P>WSBA membership</P>
<P>I have attached a WSBA membership form for all those that are interested. There is also one located at www.pazzovelo.com. Please complete this and get your registration in early. It makes life a lot simpler if you register in Jan. and not wait until the first race were there will be a long line. One suggestion from the meeting was to include the $10 fee in your club dues or if you don't have club dues then make it $10 to cover the WSBA fee. I will be ordering the 2001 season race numbers very soon so we will have them ready to mail out by Feb. 1. Then at the first race all you will have to do is fill out a waiver and you are ready to go.</P>

<P>Thanks and have a nice winter!</P>
