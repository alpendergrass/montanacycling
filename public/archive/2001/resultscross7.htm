<P>The Montana Cyclocross Championships witnessed some quick and wide-open</P>
<P>action Sunday in Helena with the Five Valley Velo club from Missoula taking</P>
<P>home the three titles up for grabs. Mark Legg won the Men’s A title for the</P>
<P>second year in a row and John Weyhrich and Chad Latino hoisted gold medals in</P>
<P>the Masters and Men’s B respectively.</P>
<P>Raw temps and grey skies greeted riders as they warmed up on the new venue at</P>
<P>Helena High School. One lap into the 12 lap race, Legg, Geoff Proctor</P>
<P>(Montana Velo) and Andy Minier (MSU) found their way to the front with a big</P>
<P>chase group close behind. The field continued to sort out on lap 2 as Proctor</P>
<P>punctured and Minier dropped back to a quartet of Montana Velos Scott Herzig,</P>
<P>Brian Wirak, Brink Kuchenbrod, and Steve Coen. After a bike change, Proctor</P>
<P>was able to get close but eventually Legg pulled away for the well-earned</P>
<P>win. In the battle for third, Minier came around Herzig on the final straight</P>
<P>to grab the bronze.</P>
<P>Many riders voiced approval of this first year venue. While half the parcours</P>
<P>consisted of pavement, the tough staired runs and the power grass sections</P>
<P>offered more than enough contrast to provide for a challenging circuit.</P>
<P>Another future plus is that the course could easily handle a large field due</P>
<P>to its ample width all the way around. </P>
<P>The race went off without a hitch thanks to the many course helpers. Carl</P>
<P>Anderberg, Joel Gerhart, all of the Montana Velo boys, Emmett Purcell, Anne</P>
<P>Blanche Adams (and everyone else who chipped in) are to be thanked. Also,</P>
<P>many thanks to Rob Whitacre for coming up from Bozeman to officiate. </P>
<P>Finally, please remember to email Jeff Crouch (jcrouch@kibogroup.com) with</P>
<P>your feedback for next year’s Montana Super Prestige Cyclocross Series. Also,</P>
<P>feel free to post your account of this final Montana ‘cross race of the</P>
<P>season.</P>
