</B></U><P>As the cross season in Montana winds towards next weeks grand finale, this Saturday's stop in Hamilton proved to be another good day of racing. The day was crystal clear and sunny with the mountains and river birch forming a beautiful backdrop for the race. Of course, none of the racers got much of a chance to enjoy the scenery as the flat barrier filled course proved to be a leg draining, heart popping challenge.</P>

<P>Race director and course designer Jeremy Oury put together a heck of a course which included two water crossing  and a smouldering pit over shich riders had to ride. Oury said after the race that next year he will probably lower the water level a bit and reduce the number of barriers. </P>

<P>The race started with a 50 yard lemond start and a long barrier free straight-away. The first lap saw Montana Velo's Geoff Proctor and Five Valley Velo's Mark Legg open a huge gap on the field. Proctor opened up his own lead on Legg in the second lap and the first two places were decided. Proctor's margin of victory ended up at 36 seconds after Legg recovered a bit from a maximum deficet of 55 seconds in the ten lap race.</P>

<P>Behind the first two racers there was some great yo-yoing among riders as the flat course tended to keep the groups together. Five Valley Velo riders Matt Seeley and Jacob Harsoch rode together for the entire race with Hatsoch edgins out Seeley by 3 seconds for third place in the Men's A race.</P>

<P>The Master's race was won by Northern Rockies rider Mike Longmire, the women's race was won by  Five Valley Velo's Margie Legg, and the Men's B race was won by Jeremy Oury (also of Five Valley Velo).</P>

<P>Many thanks to the River Ranch for allowing us to race, Jeremy Oury for doing most of the work, and all of the racers for making the trip.</P>
