</B><P>And then there's Helena's Cox Lake course. Five run-ups (four if you can hop the barrier on the last one) and a set of hurdles on a five minute circuit provide a serious mouthful for even the most seasoned cyclocross riders. Add a touch of thawing frost, some tricky pedal conditions, and a very healthy crowd of at least 40 vocal onlookers, and you've got Montana's fall version of a red-line fest. Montana Velo's Geoff Proctor took the win in the Men's A race with a time of 57:40 for 11 laps. Teammates Scott Herzig and Brink Kuchenbrod rounded out the podium with strong efforts. A big thank you goes out to course personnel Jeff Williams, Taylor Anderson, Emmet Purcell, Nadia Zylawy, Chase Carter, Anne Blanche Adams and Helena's Cox Lake residents. Special thanks are in order for landowner Gene Goodspeed. Helena area competitors are reminded that the circuit is on private land and that responsible use is critical for the future. The next stop in the Montana Super Prestige Cyclocross Series is next Sunday at Fort Missoula. Also, don't forget the State Championships in Helena on Sunday, Nov 18 at Helena High School. </P>

</B><P>Though mastery of his backyard course aided MontanaVelo's Geoff Proctor on Sunday at round three of theMontana Cyclocross series, it was strength that gothim the win. Off the line at Cox Lake in Helena, Proctor was on the sauce and away from a small butcompetitive field. Helena teammate Scott Herzig,coming off of weeks of illness, apparently enjoyed thealtitude and running sections and was never challengedin second the entire race. Andy Minier of MSU,preparing for next weekend's National CollegiateMountain Bike championships, went right through me andonto the wheel of Brink Kuchenbrod half way throughthe race and along with Proctor and Dave Hartman, wasone of few riders hopping the final hurdle and ridingthe long run up. An old hand at this sport however,Kuchenbrod used a well timed block in the final lapsto disuade Minier of his bunny-hopping and put down a surge to take a well deserved 3rd in his old hometown. Also, the Montana Velo juniors had a fine showing and Missoula's young talent has yet to challenge them in cyclocross. Helena locals fared well and other's suffered, but it all ended in smiles when memento's from this year's Tour De France where handed out for awards. Also on tap were homemade brownies, and World Cyclocross Champion Erwen Vervecken's jersey was on display. Only in Montana. If you've got that strange feeling you missed out on something you shouldn't have, there are still four races left in the Montana Series. Come join in for the hardest hour's work you'll ever do. -Jake Hartsoch</P>
