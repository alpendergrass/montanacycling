<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here's the latest entry from Jeff Seaton on MT SuperPrestige #3 from Missoula this past weekend. Thanks Stinky.&nbsp; I'm alsobeginning to get race dates for next year! Ecology SR and Columbia PlateauSR to name a few. I'll keep you posted here.</P>
<P>&nbsp; A large turnout (by racers and spectators)<BR>
&nbsp;and a blazing fast course helped make Montana<BR>
&nbsp;Superprestige #3 the most exciting cross race<BR>
&nbsp;this year.&nbsp; In the Elite race, Jamul Hahn (Nutra<BR>
&nbsp;Fig) out descended the relentless threat of<BR>
&nbsp;Jason Mohr (Northern Rockies) en route to<BR>
&nbsp;victory.&nbsp; Mohr rode aggressively on the wide,<BR>
&nbsp;meandering course, shooting into the lead over<BR>
&nbsp;the first set of barricades.&nbsp; "I knew I couldn't<BR>
&nbsp;hold off Jamul for long, but I figured it would<BR>
&nbsp;be easier to get in front sooner instead of<BR>
&nbsp;later". Hahn and Mark Legg (Golden Chain)<BR>
&nbsp;eclipsed Mohr in a fast downhill triple and rode<BR>
&nbsp;15 seconds clear after the first lap.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It looked like a repeat of Superprestige#<BR>
&nbsp;1, were Legg and Hahn battled within seconds of<BR>
&nbsp;each other, with Legg eventually emerging<BR>
&nbsp;victorious.&nbsp; However, whereas the course for #1<BR>
&nbsp;was short and technical, favoring Legg, the<BR>
&nbsp;Missoula course definitely favored Hahn as his<BR>
&nbsp;descending skills proved to put Legg out of<BR>
&nbsp;contention by the second lap.&nbsp; While Hahn rode<BR>
&nbsp;away on the long backstretch climb, Mohr and Dan<BR>
&nbsp;Swanson (MSU-GVBC) eventually were able to pick<BR>
&nbsp;off Legg, who was fading from the early effort.<BR>
&nbsp;Mohr was able to close the gap to 20 seconds on<BR>
&nbsp;the 5th lap, but Hahn was too strong, and<BR>
&nbsp;eventually won by a minute plus margin.&nbsp; Scott<BR>
&nbsp;Herzig (unattached) rode solo for the entire<BR>
&nbsp;race to take fifth, holding off a surging pack<BR>
&nbsp;comprised of Doug Swanson, Mark Knokey and Jake<BR>
&nbsp;Hutsoch.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although their field only had 4 competitors,<BR>
&nbsp;the Elite Women's race was just as action<BR>
&nbsp;packed.&nbsp; Marla Emde (Exodus) sprang to an early<BR>
&nbsp;lead over Margie Legg (Five Valley Velo).&nbsp; Emde<BR>
&nbsp;held her lead for the first few laps, gapping<BR>
&nbsp;Legg on the downhill, only to be caught on the<BR>
&nbsp;long false-flat section.&nbsp; The gap held until lap<BR>
&nbsp;4, as Legg began to settle in on the fast<BR>
&nbsp;downhill sections, where she overtook Emde for<BR>
&nbsp;good, holding on for her second victory in as<BR>
&nbsp;many tries.</P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bozeman, MT<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;October 17, 1999</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second race in the Montana SuperPrestige series was lacking the topthree<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;finishers from last week's race in Helena, but that didn't slow down thepure<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;excitement of this race. It was a cool Sunday morning in Bozeman as Doug<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swanson became the new race favorite. After overcoming a sickness lastweek, he<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was ready to show off his cross skills. Halfway though the first lap, ofthe 9 lap race,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doug Swanson took off. His Brother Dan jumped on his wheel, and the restof the<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;field were left chasing. A battle arose in the masters group early in therace<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;between Jon Engen (GVBC) and Bob Allen (??) but soon simplified into who<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;finished in front of the other. This was win number two for Jon Engen forthis year's<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;series. Look for more results from next week's race in Missoula on October24. Also,<BR>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Greetings "On the Rivet" fans. I hope your autumnis full of fun, whether you're on the cyclocross program or the off-seasonmode. I know there are mtb races still happening (last weekend at Snowbowlin Missoula and this weekend at Blue Mountain in Missoula). Then, there'sthe infamous Pattee Canyon Hillclimb on Oct. 2 in Missoula. And, of course,the cyclocross season is just around the corner. Yahoo!</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the way, the two cyclocross clinics scheduledfor this weekend in Billings and Bozeman were canceled due to perceivedlack of interest. Both clubs felt that most who might come had alreadycome to the clinics last year and felt it would be best to hold off. Fineby me. I love to do them, but with a full cyclocross season coming, I don'tmind being able to stay at home. I did do a first-time Trek Barr cyclocrossclinic in Spokane last weekend and we had about 25. Good fun for all. Checkout the Baddlands Cyclocross Series. I know some of them will be makingthe trip to at least the Missoula cross races.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Missoula's Mr. Bike Man Jeff Crouch (whom we owemany thanks for all of his efforts to promote bike racing) is in need ofcash to maintain this website. Five Valley Velo, Montana Velo and GallatinValley Bicycle Club are the three clubs who have made a $50 contribution.Northern Rockies, Flathead Velo, Yellowstone Valley CC, Echelon and GreatDivide need to be asked to contribute. I'm hopeful we can keep it up. It'sthe one way I, as District Rep, can maintain some form of consistent communication.I hope to do the same kind of updates next season. Please let me know whatyou think. (radsimunek@aol.com).</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, as many of you have seen, Butte native LeviLeipheimer has signed with US Postal for next year. Could the first nativeMontanan be riding the Tour de France next year????</P>

_ to a sucessful conclusion a week ago Sunday in Lincoln, MT. Ridersfrom all over the region, from Canada to California, raced from Lincolnto Helena over Flesher Pass on Saturday and back again, either over Flesheror McDonald Pass, on Sunday. The two-day event was marked by what has becomea tradition in Montana cycling: aggressive riding contested by small, buthighly talented fields. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Missoula's Monica Tranel (5 Valley Velo) showedher climbing and sprinting prowess by winning both days. Her results wereparticularly impressive given that she had to battle a tough women's teamfrom Calgary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mark Legg (Northern Rockies), a transplanted New Zealanderliving in Missoula, edged out Brink Kuchenbrod (Montana Velo) and KieferHahn (Wizards) in the elite men's race. A highlight was watching Legg,Kuchenbrod, and Hahn climb McDonald Pass in 28:30 through heavy wind andspitting sleet. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Promoter Geoff Proctor and the Montana Velo CyclingTeam graciously express their thanks to Dean Yonkovich at Hi-Country SnackFoods, Eric Griffin and the Lewis and Clark County Road Dept., CellularOne, the Helena Police Department, Ken Stuker, Bill Ridgway and all ofthe custodians at Helena High School, and all of the volunteers who madethe event possible.

Chris Pannell&nbsp; Gallatin Valley/ Bozeman&nbsp; 8th;9th&nbsp; 15 _ June 3, 1999 The Trek Barr Challenge Stage Race is set for thisweekend. Weather should be ok with temps in the 50-70's range with cloudsand hopefully minimal showers. Today, Thursday, it's raining, but the outlookis better for the weekend. The courses look good with only one gravellysection on the first day's descent and one flat 5 mile stretch of a fewpotholes. Otherwise, roads are in good condition. I know a lot of you havebeen racing a bunch, but I hope to see you this weekend! We need to supportas many of the Montana races as our busy schedules will allow. Some ridersfrom Calgary and Boise are making the trip. Salt Lake had a race cancelledthis weekend, so we shall see. Lots of other tidbits to pass along. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--I spoke with Helena District Crit Promoter Joel Gerhard last night andthe Helena District Crit is going to be rescheduled from next weekend dueto problems with the course/city officials. It might very well be rescheduledfor Saturday, July 31. Check back here for more details. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --I got anemail from Steve Muller up in Kalispell and, tentatively, the Tour of theFlathead is going to move to July 17,18 from its traditional Labor Daydate. Check back here for more details. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --I need to speak with JoeLemire of Bozeman to confirm his Sweet Pea Stage Race dates of July 24,25.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --I know that Art Maxwell is planning on promoting the Fat Tire Frenzymtb races in Red Lodge on the same weekend (July 24, 25). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --I alsoknow that Andrew Schreiner is hoping to designate his Lone Peak's Revengemtb weekend of Aug. 21, 22 as the Montana State Mountain Bike Championships(xc, dh, and maybe more). Art Maxwell of Red Lodge and Andrew are sortingout who gets the state champs designation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --I got a call from Danielleat the Snowshoe Shop (I think that was the name of the shop) up in Libby,MT. She wanted to get word out on the Turner Burner MTB race scheduledfor July 17. Call 406-293-3890 for details. Finally, it's super week onthe east coast for our country's best riders. Hamilton's Jason Van Marle(Nutra Fig) had a 20th place in Wilmington, DE this past Sunday and Butte'sLevi Leipheimer (Saturn) placed 12th in Lancaster, PA on Tuesday. All ofus in Montana wish these guys the best on Sunday at the USPRO in Philly.It's certainly one of the biggest opportunities for them so far in theircareers and they seem to be going well at the moment. Hope to see you allthis weekend, geoff proctor _ May 27, 1999 Just back from the ColumbiaRiver Plateau Stage Race in eastern Oregon. What a race! The terrain--damnchallenging and the non-race facilities truly heartland. Plenty of soul-searchingmoments had by all. And the Montana presence was FELT! Hell, we had FredMichini (Five Valley Velo), John Weyrich (Five Valley Velo) and Joe Lemire(GVBC) dicing in the masters,&nbsp; Matt Seeley (Five Valley Velo) and JoelBiederman (GVBC) raging in the cat 3/4s, Keifer Hahn (Wizards), Jamul Hahn(Nutra Fig), and Brink Kuchenbrod (Montana Velo) all figuring in the Pro/1/2,MC Jenni (GVBC) and Wendy (GVBC?) and many others all turning the pedalsover quite well thank you very much. Really pleasing to see our ridershipgetting out to test the waters against the region's best. My race (theTrek Barr Challenge Stage Race) is coming next weekend, June 5,6. I'veemailed all club liasons with the ultimatum to get me fairly precise numbersof club members planning on eating/sleeping here in Helena. I need to knowby Monday night (May 31) so we have enough food on hand for dinner andbreakfast. Any out-of-staters and unattached riders should email me directly(radsimunek@aol.com). By the way, the Trek Barr Challenge SR is the sameweekend as the Governor's Cup and there's a big horse race as well, soit'll be hopping here in Helena. Weather is good now...gotta ride. chowder,geoff proctor _ &nbsp; May 13, 1999 Not much to report this week. I was unableto race the Fairfield/Great Falls race last Saturday put on by John Jurasand the Echelon CC crew. From all reports the racing was challenging, incourse and character. Thanks Echelon!!! Next up in the Montana Cup is mystage race here in the Helena/Lincoln area. In-state riders should be gettinga mailing soon. Lots of good out-of-state racing coming the next few weeks.Enumclaw (WA), Columbia Plateau (OR), and Tri-Cities (WA) all look to besolid tests. Clearly, Gila down in New Mexico was epic. That sounds likea beast of a race. Right now in Helena, the snow seems to have stopped.Out riding, I've only caught that springtime cottonwood bud scent alongcreek crossings once so far. Either Helena doesn't have too many cottonwoodsor we aren't into spring yet. My hunch is it's the latter, but then again,I ain't no stinkin' arborist either. until next week, geoff proctor MontanaDistrict Rep _ May 6, 1999 Well, three cheers for another great race, thistime put on by Northern Rockies. Dan Dahlberg, Len LeBuff and the restof the Northern Rockies crew did a great job with course and personnel.Montana racing is happenin'! Come join the fun. Legs and lungs are allyou need. I was on the phone with a guy from Excell Sports in Boulder,CO the other day and he told me he's contemplating a move to Missoula orHelena. I asked why and he said that Boulder, CO is "played out" and he'slooking for the next playful spot. So, the hip and groove migration continues!A couple of notes: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --The first Billings MTB race scheduled for thispast weekend had to be changed. The first Dick Blee Memorial MTB race isJune 13 (contact Lance Wehner @ 406-652-1202) and the #2 race is now July11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --Jose Lemire out of Livingston and GVBC has informed us of a dateand name change on the Sweet Pea Stage Race. The race is now slated forthe weekend of July 24, 25 and will be a stage race of Lemirian proportions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --Also note (Joe, not sure if you are aware), that Art Maxwell hasscheduled the Fat Tire Frenzy MTB races in Red Lodge for that weekend aswell (July 24, 25). Is this a conflict we might be able to avoid??? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--Jeff Crouch (5 Valley Velo) has worked wonders to get this website onthe map (among other contributions). He has informed me that each clubneeds to send him $50 to cover expenses. I will be contacting each clubliason about this but I wanted to make it public so that you all can thankJeff next time you see him. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --The Trek Barr Challenge Stage Race iscoming soon! You'll be getting a mailing, but if you want to check specs,you can find it at our Montana Velo Website (http://littlehouse.prairie.edu/~kuch)along with legend Joe Lemire's colorful prose and 10 speed racing withthe Brinkster twist. If anyone ever wants to get news to this column justlet me know. I'll try to update weekly. until next week, geoff proctorMontana District Rep. _ April 30, 1999 We're getting after it now. As Montanaroad and mountain bike events begin to "come thick and fast" (to borrowPaul Sherwen's favorite phrase), everyone's happy to be racing again. Rememberto thank the promoters and volunteers...it goes a long way towards eventsbeing held next year. Rocky Mountain Roubaix came off in its usual kick-assfashion. Very rocky this year with lots and lots of punctures. I lost countafter my 8th due to poor tire selection. I do know that I went throughmy 2 spares in the wheelcar, the 2 new tubes I carried along with my CO2cartridges, and all of the patches and glue in my patch kit. Nonetheless,it was great to see lots of our state's top racers making the race. LewisElliot (OMO/YVCC) came over from Billings; the just-returned-from-Tour-of-Willamette-ridersJamul Hahn (Nutra Fig), Kiefer Hahn (Wizards), the Jenni's (Tom and MC/GVBC)were in the mix; and the local riders were all anxious to turn over legsand rocks. Promoter Dale Bickel did a stellar job once again with thispretty unpredictable race. And helmets off to old friend Howard Hickingbotham(Montana Velo) who drove a pretty suave wheelcar! Tom Jenni in Bozemanhas emailed me his Montana Cup Points structure. For the most part thepoints break-down looks good; especially the stipulation that promotershave 3 weeks to email Tom their results if they want their race configuredin the Cup Standings. I hope this will go a long way towards getting resultstabulated and out in a timely fashion. I continue to be amazed at how poorlythis is done on a national level. Many big races go unreported. It seemsodd in this electronic age that we can't do better. Lately, I've been busywith a lot of upgrade requests. Please consult the rulebook for the policy.The only difference is that races in Montana receive half points due tosmall field sizes. Also, remember the following steps: 1) send me yourresults from the past 12 months (give race, location, category raced in,place, number of starters). Keep in mind that local training series racesdon't count, nor do time trials; 2) enclose a statement formally requestingwhat you want; 3) enclose a self-addressed stamped envelope; and 4) yourcurrent 1999 license. If you don't have your 1999 license, deal directlywith USA Cycling. Send all of this to me via snailmail: Geoff Proctor,1822 Dry Gulch Drive, Helena, MT 59601. If you want to expedite things,send me your statement and results via email to radsimunek@aol.com andthen send your license and SASE via regular mail. until next week, geoff&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; +DAugust 9, 1999 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What a great weekend of racing in Missoulaat the Ecology Center Stage Race. Jeff Crouch, Jeff Goin and all the othersdid a pretty darn good job. And, as usual, having Bill (can't rememberhis last name) as Chief Referee is always reassuring for the riders. Iremember his officiating presence as far back as 1987 in Yakima and Cheney.They don't come much better than big, bad Bill. While having little effecton the overall, the Friday Night Street Sprints were great for bike racingas a spectacle. The crowd was well-sudsed and vocal and the riders didnot disappoint. Saturday's Perma RR was savage as expected. And Sunday'stt and crit were full of good rides. I counted 84 total riders. Hope therace can keep moving forward. We road racers are lucky to have a race ofthis calibre in Montana. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The mountain bike season is still in full-swingwith races in Sandpoint, Big Sky and Big Moutain all coming up. As faras I know, the Big Mountain race at the end of August is the designatedstate mtb championships.MTB State Champion patches are at stake for elitemen and women! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cyclocross season is still coming together. I promiseI'll have it here for you by August 21. The schedule you see on bikeride.comis not correct, so don't plan your season just yet. On the other hand,with the current farewars set to expire Aug 12, now's the time to get ticketsif you're Super Cup bound. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's been a very good road season, in termsof race promotion and race tactics. Our numbers could always be better,&nbsp;but we're getting some new, energetic young racers, so that's encouraging.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until next time, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; geoff proctor &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; USCF District Rep &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1822 DryGulch &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Helena, MT 59601 _ July 26, 1999 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So much to report and I'vebeen unable to get this column up and going again. Hope it's working now.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So here we are with just 2 races (Helena District Crit this Saturdayand the Ecology Stage Race in Missoula in early August) left on the Montanaroad calendar. It seems to be winding down quickly but, as always, ourstate has trouble drawing numbers with such a small ridership and everyone'svarying interests and motivations. Kudos to Stan Watkins and all of theKalispell folks who put together the Tour of the Flathead a few weeks ago.The same thanks go to Joe Lemire and GVBC for the Battle Ridge Stage Racethis past weekend. We will have to take a hard look at how our calendarprogresses throughout the year to maximize turn-out for promoters' sake.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The mountain bike scene has been active as well with recent races inBozeman (Bohart Ranch) and Red Lodge (Fat Tire Frenzy). Many thanks tothe Bozeman gang and Art Maxwell for promoting the racing. I've spokento Andrew Schreiner about his upcoming Lone Peak's Revenge IV MTB at BigSky the weekend of Aug. 21 and it sounds like he's got a good one.
