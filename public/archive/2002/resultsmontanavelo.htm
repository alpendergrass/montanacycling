<P>With the 100th edition of Paris-Roubaix cycling classic a half a world away, </P>
<P>the Montana Velo Road Race offered up an epic parallel yesterday in Helena. </P>
<P>The hardy Montana peloton braved heavy rain, slick gravelled mud, and the </P>
<P>ever-present "Montana mistral" that blows off the east side of the Divide to </P>
<P>more than earn their oats in, this, the second Strong Frames of Montana </P>
<P>Series race for 2002.    </P>

<P>Doing his best Johan Museeuw imitation, Scott Herzig (Montana Velo) got </P>
<P>himself off the front during the first of three 20-mile laps and never looked </P>
<P>back to score a convincing victory in the cat. 1,2,3 race. </P>

<P>By contrast, Kelly Parsley (Great Divide Cycling Team) came first by a nose </P>
<P>in the very closely contested three-up sprint of the women's 40-mile race.</P>

<P>Owen Gue (Northern Rockies) not only took his second junior race of the 2002 </P>
<P>series but also won the entire field sprint with the mixed-in 4,5's and </P>
<P>masters. </P>

<P>Equally impressive was the triumvirate of Montana Velo junior women--Metta </P>
<P>Gilbert, Lindsay Grovom, and Tracy Wirak--who gave it everything to hang with </P>
<P>the group during the first lap deluge. </P>

<P>Other category winners were Seth Hansen (Northern Rockies) in the cat. 4,5 </P>
<P>race, Keith Carperelli (Great Divide Cycling Team) in the Masters 35+ race, </P>
<P>and Steve Muller (Northern Rockies) in the 45+ race.</P>

<P>Another race, surely. But equally so, another batch of stories to tell when </P>
<P>one is finally home and all comfy and warm. Sure, as a promoter, I took a </P>
<P>small hit financially and, sure, I wouldn't have if I hadn't paid out as much </P>
<P>in prizes. But, as a promoter and a competitor of umpteen of these gigs, I </P>
<P>know it's the stories that keep you going and bring again that freshness to </P>
<P>your legs and dreams of riding like the Lion of Flanders.</P>

<P>Thanks to all of my race help: Nadia Zylawy, Carl Anderberg, Brink </P>
<P>Kuchenbrod, AB Adams, Rhonda ?, Pat Morrison, Joel Gerhart, Steve and Megan </P>
<P>Field, the finish line crew and many others. Also, if anyone has any photos </P>
<P>of the race, let me know.</P>

<P>and thanks to all those who said thanks (it really does go a long ways),</P>
