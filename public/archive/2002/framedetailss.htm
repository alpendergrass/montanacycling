<P ALIGN="CENTER">Win Two Gift Certificates for Custom Frames!</P>
</B></U><P ALIGN="CENTER">Strong Frames believes in bike racing in Montana and they have donated two custom frames to the 2002 Montana racing series!</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Racers will have their name entered into the drawing for the frame every time they race in a series event. In addition, racers will have their name added into the drawing an additional time every time they win their category in a series event.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">At the end of the year we will hold a random drawing and award one frame to someone from the Mountain Bike Series and one frame to someone from the Road Racing Series. Each winner will receive a certificate for a standard custom designed and painted frame from Carl Strong and the rest of the folks in Bozeman.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">In addition special awards will be given to the series leaders at the end of the year.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Many Thanks To All of the Race Directors and To Strong Frames!</P>
